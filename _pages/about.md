I’m a final‑year PhD candidate at TU Darmstadt, under the supervision of [Jean Paul Degabriele](https://degabriele.info). My research centers around symmetric-key cryptography, particularly on the eﬃcient design, analysis, and implementation of provably secure schemes with real-world applications. 

In Fall 2024, I visited the Cryptography Group at the University of Washington, hosted by [Stefano Tessaro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tessaro/). Previously, I was a research intern in the [Cryptography Research Center (CRC) of TII](https://www.tii.ae/cryptography) and in the [LIP6 Computer Science Laboratory](https://www.lip6.fr). I hold a Master degree in Mathematics (Paris Cité University) and Computer Science (Sorbonne University).
