I am a PhD candidate in the [Cryptography and Network Security (CNS) Group](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/cns/main/index.en.jsp) at TU Darmstadt, under the supervision of [Dr. Jean Paul Degabriele](https://degabriele.info). My research centers around symmetric-key cryptography, particularly on the design and analysis of provably secure schemes with real-world applications. More generally, I am interested in mathematics, IT security and cryptology.

Previously, I obtained a Master in Mathematics with applications to Cryptology from Paris Diderot University (now Paris Cité University) and a Master in Computer Science from Pierre and Marie Curie University (now Sorbonne University).
